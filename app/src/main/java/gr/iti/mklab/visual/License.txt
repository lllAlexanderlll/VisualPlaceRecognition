The code for the VLAD-PQ framework implementation was taken from https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/multimedia-indexing
The modified code can be found here: app/src/main/java/gr/iti/mklab/visual

* utilities/RandomRotation.java
* utilities/AnswerWithGeolocation.java
* utilities/MetaDataEntity.java
* utilities/FeatureIO.java
* utilities/Normalization.java
* utilities/RandomPermutation.java
* utilities/Answer.java
* utilities/Result.java

datastructures
* datastructures/AbstractSearchStructure.java
* datastructures/IVFPQ.java
* datastructures/Linear.java
* datastructures/PQ.java

dimreduction
* dimreduction/PCA.java

extraction
* extraction/AbstractFeatureExtractor.java
* extraction/SURFExtractor.java

aggregation
* aggregation/VladAggregatorMultipleVocabularies.java
* aggregation/AbstractFeatureAggregator.java
* aggregation/BowAggregator.java
* aggregation/VladAggregator.java


Also the dependency to java.awt.* was removed

java.awt.image.BufferedImage replaced by android.graphics.Bitmap

The BoofCV version 0.27 and the boofcv-android package is used:

Since the feature extractor and descriptor interfaces and packages changed in 0.27,
their code is adapted.
